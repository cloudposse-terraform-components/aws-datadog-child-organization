# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform component to provision a Datadog child organization using the Datadog provider.
  Datadog API/App keys and API URL are sourced via the `aws-datadog-credentials` component module; you only need to provide the child organization name and AWS region.

  This project is supported by the [Datadog Open Source Program](https://www.datadoghq.com/partner/open-source/).

  As part of this collaboration, Datadog provides a dedicated sandbox account that we use for automated integration and acceptance testing. This contribution allows us to continuously validate changes against a real Datadog environment, improving reliability and reducing the risk of regressions.

  We are grateful to Datadog for supporting our open source ecosystem and helping ensure that infrastructure code for Terraform remains stable and well-tested
